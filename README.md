# Lacks-Charging-Sim
Event driven charging-in-a-box simulation for particles.

Code for the charging simulation demonstrated by Lacks and Levandovsky in 2007 (10.1016/j.elstat.2006.07.010). Several improvements made to increase speed based on Smallenburg (10.1140/epje/s10189-022-00180-8), and to model the size distribution sampled by Raack et al. (10.1089/ast.2016.1544).
